# SORA Development Public Request for Proposal (RFP) Process

SORA, Polkaswap, and other apps on the SORA network all follow a decentralized development process. This means that anyone can make proposals for new features, then proposals for implementation will come from teams that can implement those features, and the community will vote on the best proposal.

- To make the process easier and more accessible, RFP will now be submitted as [GitHub issues](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues).
- To create an RFP, navigate to the issues section, create a new issue, then click **Get Started** in the new "Request for Proposal" template. 

RFPs should roughly follow the following format:

- Proposal Due Date
- Proposal Overview
- Proposal Goals (list with explanations where possible)
- Scope of Work (describe the scope of work in as much detail as possible)
- Current Roadblocks and Barriers to Success
- Evaluation Metrics and Criteria (definition of done should be as clear as possible)
- Submission Requirements
- Submission Method (which folder on GitHub to submit a proposal to)

Optional Details:
- Project Due Date
- Budget Amount

In responding to an RFP, individuals and teams are able to follow any format that they like, but it should be submitted in accordance with the RFP submission method. As this is a public RFP process, trade secrets and other non-public information should never be included in any proposals.
